# Image Classification Project

## Overview
This project is focused on exploring and preparing images for emotion classification using convolutional neural networks. The libraries used include:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pandas

## Getting Started
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow keras pandas
   ```
3. Add your dataset to the project directory.

## Project Structure
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`: Custom instructions for GitHub Copilot.
- `README.md`: Project overview and setup instructions.

## Next Steps
- Perform exploratory data analysis using Pandas.
- Preprocess images for training.
- Build and train a convolutional neural network for emotion classification.
